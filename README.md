# Project-for-Code-Louisville
My project is a website for my mother. She is an artist and needs a place to display and sell her art. My intention was to create the home page for now and continue to add on and develop additional pages with information on her paitings later. I have included a navigation menu that expands and collapses when clicking the hamburger icon that scrolls to either her contact or more about her. I have used CSS Grid to show the wrapper and was able to wrap my content around. I created a contact form with name, email, address and information box for someone to put information about what type of art piece they would like to purchase. I hope you enjoy navigating my very first website!
